												<p>A Pirates Duel was a group project I undertook with several classmates during a Peterborough Game Jam, and is a networked 1v1 pirate battle. The game takes place atop a ship in a pirate fleet, and requires the player to kill their opponent using slashes and blocks.</p>

											<p>Get Toasted is my first large Android game, starring a very enthusiastic piece of toast on his journey across the kitchen table. The game functions as a infinite runner, with enemies increasing in speed, with a variety of different enemies, from jalapenos to pancakes.</p>

													</video><p>Very early in my Game Development Education, I attended the SemiAnnual Peterborough Game Jam. I was still unfamiliar with unity, yet was able to create a very solid recreation of the arcade classic Joust. At the time of first making it the main jousting mechanic was unfinished, yet enemies would be killed and new wave would spawn after they all died, incrementing score as they die. </p>

  													<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3clrsAo8wzk" width="420" height="340" ></iframe>
													<p>During my internship for my eduction at TriOS, i worked for my collegue and teacher Richard Als,as well as another intern on a mobile title called Got The Touch. At present the game has yet to be released, yet soon will be launched on both android and IOS. The goal of the game is to keep up with the speed and tap corresponding circles that match what the game indicates. The game was an excellent title that i learned much from, serving as a crash course in the game development life cycle from design to post production</p>
